# This is a heading

Here's some content with a code block:

```javascript
console.log("Hello, world!");
const greeting = "This should be highlighted!";
function welcome(name) {
  return `Welcome to ${name}!`;
}
This should have beautiful syntax highlighting!
Another heading
With automatic anchor links that you can click.
More code examples:
css.button {
  background: #3b82f6;
  color: white;
  padding: 0.5rem 1rem;
  border-radius: 0.5rem;
}
Pretty neat, right?
